# ReactJS with Redux Portfolio Site Client Front End
Created by Ben Greenberg


## About

This is a portfolio site front end built with ReactJS and Redux middleware. It was built specifically to display my portfolio site at http://www.bengreenberg.org.

## Installation

To use this frontend client, simply fork a copy of it and then clone it down into your local server. You need to install the required Node packages with your preferred node package manager. Running `npm start`, for example, will boot up a localhost server.

This frontend assumes a relationship with an API to fetch the data for the site.
